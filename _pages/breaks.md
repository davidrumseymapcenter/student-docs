If you work more than three and a half hours in a day, you are entitiled to a paid 15-minute break. Per the [Admin Guide 2.1.5](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/compensation-staff-employees): 

*"The university provides non-exempt employees a 15-minute paid, duty-free rest break for each four hours of work or "major fraction" of four hours of work (i.e., more than two hours), provided the employees work at least three-and-one-half hours per day. Insofar as practicable, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of each work period. Rest breaks are duty-free time and employees are free to leave the premises, where practicable. Rest breaks should also be arranged so that disruptions of work and services are held to a minimum. Employees are not permitted to use their rest breaks to shorten the workday or to extend the meal period."*

When you go to take a break, coordinate with your supervisor so that the reference desk is covered while you are out.
