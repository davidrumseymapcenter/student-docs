## Earthquakes

During an earthquake, if you are indoors:
- Immediately “duck, cover, and hold” under a desk, table or chair,  between seating rows in classrooms, against a corridor wall.
- If you're are unable to get under something, cover your head with your arms to help protect against falling objects.
*Note:* Wheelchair users: Apply the brakes. Cover your head with your arms to help protect against falling objects. Ask for assistance.
- Do not go into a doorway.
- Do not run or panic.
- Move away from the danger areas: near windows, hanging objects, tall unsecured furniture (bookcases, cabinets, and appliances), and research or process equipment containing hazardous chemicals. Most casualties in earthquakes result from falling materials.
- Stay inside under cover until the shaking stops.
- Watch for falling objects.
- As you leave the area, and if safe to do so, turn off and disconnect power to equipment containing hazardous materials unless needed to keep process or experiment safe.
- Make note of any unsafe conditions, trapped personnel or other hazards to be reported when you evacuate to your EAP.

## Fire Alarms

When you hear the fire alarm:

- Evacuate the building immediately.
- If it is safe to do so, take your emergency supplies, car keys, purse and/or wallet, and other personal items (depending on the situation, re-entry to the building may not be available for some time).
- Shut down all hazardous operations, if safe to do so.
- Turn off equipment, if safe to do so.
- Close doors, but do not lock them.
- Exit by the nearest safe exit/stairwell. Do not use elevators.
- While exiting, note hazards or personnel remaining in building.
- Go directly to the designated Emergency Assembly Point (EAP) for the building you are in. *Note:* The EAP for the Rumsey Center is the fountain in front of the Bing Wing entrance to Green Library.
- Check in and provide information on noted hazards or personnel remaining in the building to your Response Team member.

## Emergency Kit

There is a red, lunchbox-looking emergency kit stored below the reference desk. It contains emergency supplies ranging from first aid materials to granola bars and water.

## Panic Button

We have a panic button for you to use in case of an emergency. Information about using it is shared with you during your onboarding. If you have questions, please feel free to ask at anytime.
