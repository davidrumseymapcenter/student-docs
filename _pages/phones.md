# Answering the Phone at the Rumsey Center
Answer with, “Hi, thank you for calling the David Rumsey Map Center, this is [name]. How can I help you?”
While on the phone, complete one of the “Hi, thank you for calling the DRMC…” forms in the Student Staff binder on the Reference Desk.

**Common questions:**


**Q:** What are your open hours?\
**A:** We are open 1-5pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and 9:30am-5pm on Fridays, but please check our website [https://library-hours.stanford.edu/libraries/rumsey](https://library-hours.stanford.edu/libraries/rumsey) before visiting as we occasionally close during those times to host pre-booked classes and tours.

**Q:** I would like help finding a map for a project I’m working on.\
**A:** The best way to get one on one help with leveraging our map collection for your project is to schedule a 1:1 meeting with our Rare Maps Librarian, Kristina Larsen. Would you be interested in that?\
[If yes] What’s your email address? I will send you a link where you can go online to to book a time with her.
- Ask Niles to send the email: [https://appointments.library.stanford.edu/appointments/kristina](https://appointments.library.stanford.edu/appointments/kristina)


[If no] If you want to drop into the Center to get help with finding a map to your project, [reference to Answer about open hours] 

**Q:** I would like to donate a map. Would you like it?\
**A:** Thank you for offering to donate your map(s). This is at the discretion of the Curator of the David Rumsey Map Center. If you could describe the map(s) you’d like to donate and provide me with your contact information, I will pass along your message to our Curator and get back to you with a response. 
[Get description, number of items. Get name, phone number, email address of caller. Write it all down clearly and give to Niles who will raise the question with the Curator.]

**Q:** I would like to learn more about what the maps I own are worth.\
**A:** We’re not able to help you directly with this request. We recommend you contact an appraiser like Barry Lawrence Ruderman [https://www.raremaps.com](https://www.raremaps.com) for assistance. You may be able to find maps similar to the one you have in their catalog, either currently for sale or in the Sold section, which you can search via the Advanced Search option on their website.

**Q:** I’m on my way to visit the center. Where is the nearest parking?\
**A:** The closest visitor parking to the Rumsey Center is in the Roth Way Garage located at 355 Roth Way, Stanford, CA 94305. It is approximately a 15 minute walk from the center. However, all parking on campus is free after 4pm. If it is after 4pm, the closest available parking is located by the Bing Auditorium.

Feel free to grab Niles if you’re not sure how to respond to a caller’s request.
