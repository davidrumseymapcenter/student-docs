## History of the Center
- The Center was established in 2016 when David Rumsey donated his map collection to Stanford University.
- David Rumsey is alive and well. He lives in San Francisco and actively participates in the running of the Map Center by curating exhibits, scanning maps, and hosting events.
- David has a background in fine art – he was part of an artist collective called Pulsa when he was in his twenties, and their collective exhibited work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He made his fortune in real estate, a career he pursued after working in fine art.

## How the Center is used
- We are a traditional special collections library with a reading room 
80% of our collections are scanned and available for viewing & downloading on [davidrumsey.com](https://www.davidrumsey.com). The fact that so much of the collection is available for free for anyone to access around the world is one of the ways that the Rumsey Collection distinguishes itself from other prominent map collections.
- For those who need to view physical maps, they can request to view them in advance of their visit on Searchworks.
- Professors and educators outside of Stanford visit the Center to teach classes featuring maps from our collection. 
[You can provide an example of a class you remember coming through the Center here.]
- We also host talks & conferences and show exhibitions.
- We’ve had talks from a variety of speakers – academics, independent scholars, journalists, artists, government officials, etc.
- Most of our talks and conferences are available to watch via livestream on Zoom; they also get recorded and posted to our YouTube channel.
- There are other map libraries across the US, but our map library is known for its technology – we have three touchscreens – two tabletops and one 12 ft x 7 ft wall screen –  as well as an additional 16 x 9 ft screen.
- The tabletop touchscreen was meant to create the feeling of standing around a table looking at a physical map.
- The larger screens allow anyone, and in particular those doing in-depth research, to look at the many details on maps.

## About the map collection 
- The Rumsey Map Collection includes approximately 132,000 maps. We are in the process of transporting the physical maps from David’s personal collection in San Francisco to Stanford, and right now we have approximately 16,000 maps here. 
- The number of maps in David Rumsey’s collection changes every day as David Rumsey acquires new maps.
- How one can count maps is up for interpretation. For example, an atlas could count as a single map, or each individual plate in the atlas could count as a separate map. David Rumsey counts the per page or per scan. 
- Eventually, Stanford will be home to all of the maps in David Rumsey’s collection.
- The oldest item in the collection is from 1474. It’s actually a page from a book which depicts a view of Jerusalem.
