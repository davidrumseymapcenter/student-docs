## Pay Periods and Pay Dates

There are two pay periods per month: one lasting from the first of the month through the 16th, and another from the 17th to the last day of the month. You must have all your hours logged in your timecard by the end of the pay period so that your supervisor can approve your timecard and you can receive your paycheck.

You will receive two paychecks each month, one on the 7th of the month and one on the 22nd. If you do not set up direct deposit through your Axess portal, your paychecks will be delivered as paper envelopes to the Rumsey Center. 

## Logging Hours in Axess

To enter hours into your timecard, log on to your Axess employee view and click "View/Edit Timecard." On this page you will be able to enter in the hours you worked over the current pay period. To save your logged hours, click "Submit and Approve." 

Please log, submit, and approve the hours you worked that day at the end of each of your shifts. If you require more shift slots than are provided on Axess by default, scroll to the far right of the relevant day row and hit the plus icon.
