# Giving a Tour of the Rumsey Map Center

On Fridays, the David Rumsey Map Center offers in-depth, guided tours from 2-3pm. These tours are more involved than the quick walkaround/orientation you give to visitors when they drop in, and often last around 45 minutes total. Below are topics to cover if you are asked to lead one of these guided tours.

## Introducing the Center
See [here](/student-docs/drmc/history) for an overview of the Rumsey Center, its mission, and its resources.

## 3x3 Screen Overview
The 3x3 screen displays [www.davidrumsey.com](www.davidrumsey.com). This is David Rumsey’s personal website where he hosts high-resolution scans of his 130,000+ maps. This website is not exclusive to the Rumsey Center– you can access this website on any device with a web browser. The site allows you to browse and download these images, and the homepage displays a rotating curated selection of maps.

**Notable Features**
- Viewing maps
- Advanced search
- Text on maps search
- MapRankSearch
- Georeferencer

## 4x4 Screen Overview
The 4x4 screen displays Google Earth Pro. You can download this software for free on your home computer and it comes packaged with a collection of georeferenced Rumsey Historical Maps.

**Notable Features**
- Overlay georeferenced maps
- Adjust image transparency
- View 3D georeferenced maps

## Ideum Board Overview
The Ideum board in the center is one of two we have here at the Rumsey Center, the other of which is located outside the entrance to the stairwell. We run a web app called Terra on these boards, which displays Rumsey Collection Globes and Maps. The app has two modes worth showing visitors, each of which are outlined below.

**Globes:** to access the globes, tap the globe icon towards the bottom left of the screen. If you don’t see the icon, tap the three lines at the very bottom left of the screen to bring up the mode selection menu. This mode displays a number of high-resolution scans of globes in the Rumsey Collection. Tap on any globe to bring it up, after which you can rotate it and resize it as desired. Tap the yellow “X CLOSE” on the right side of the screen to return the previous page. There are additionally four globes along the bottom of the screen which, upon selection, display the globe as if you were inside it looking out. Tap the info icon towards the bottom right of the screen to bring up information on the globe you’re currently viewing.

**Waterfall:** to access the waterfall, tap the waterfall icon towards the bottom left of the screen. This mode displays a scrolling view of a selection of maps curated by David. You can tap on any map preview to bring it up, move it, rotate it, or resize it as you please. Tap the info icon towards the bottom right of the screen to bring up information on the map you’re currently viewing.

## Exhibitions Overview
We have rotating exhibitions at the Rumsey Center, visible in the glass cases around the center: three along the wall to the right of the 4x4, one on either side of the 3x3, and three horizontal cases in between the two antiquarian globe displays. The current exhibition is focused around Urbano Monte’s 1587 world map (a material we have in our collection here), which is the largest known early world map. Professor Paula Findlen taught a class during the winter quarter that worked extensively with this map, and much of the exhibition was put together by students in the class. The last exhibition was centered on presentations given at the Barry Lawrence Ruderman Conference on Cartography which we hosted in October 2023, and the next exhibition is actively being developed by the winner of our Student Exhibition Competition, a competition put on by us in collaboration with the California Map Society.

## The Bellerby Globe
This globe was custom made for us by hand by Bellerby & Co., a London-based globemaking company. Encourage visitors to spin the globe (it is very much hands-on!), and point out that the David Rumsey Map Center itself is noted on the globe.
