As a Rumsey Center student worker, your main priority is to staff the reference desk, greet & help visitors sign in, and give brief tours to introduce visitors to the center. When not actively working with visitors, you should be working on student projects assigned by your supervisor.


**When a patron arrives, do *three* things:** 

1. Have the patron sign the policy acknowledgment form at the front desk tablet. Every adult must register. An easy way to get visitors’ attention is to say, “Hi, are you here to visit the center?”

2. Kindly ask that patrons with bags or coats/jackets place their items in the lockers behind them, giving them a key from the front desk.
If a patron takes a key, please ask for their ID. You can give them their ID back once they return their locker key

3. Briefly introduce the Center to give the patrons an overview of the Center’s history and/or to provide them a little bit of context about the current exhibition.
- You can make your intro spiel your own, but feel free to reference the information [here](/drmc) to come up with an intro that interests visitors.
- You can include one tidbit from each of the sections linked above, or you can simply choose the stories/information that excite you the most. 
- If you're feeling up to going more in-depth, information on how to give a formal tour can be found [here](/handbook/tours).

**Restroom Key**\
We have a restroom that visitors can use, located across the room from the reference desk. The key to the restroom is located by the iPad on the reference desk. Even with the key, the door handle does not turn. To open the restroom door, put the key in the lock, turn it, and push.

**Alarmed Doors**\
The doors on either side of the 4x4 screen to the elevator and the Bender Room are unlocked but alarmed (unless they are actively propped open for events). If you or a visitor wants to go to the Bender Room or use the elevator, come get a member of the Rumsey Staff and we will open the door for you. If you or a visitor accidentally sets off the alarm, do not fear! A member of the Rumsey Staff will surely hear and come running to shut off the alarm.

**Doorbells**\
We have two doorbells, one for the stairwell entrance and one for the elevator entrance. The stairwell doorbell plays a short, two-tone chime while the elevator doorbell is much more drawn out and melodic. You will most likely not have to deal with the main entrance doorbell as the center will be open while you are working, but visitors accessing the center via the elevator will need to be let in. When the elevator doorbell rings, a member of the Rumsey Staff will most likely come to open the door. However, if that doesn’t happen, please let one of us know that someone is here and needs to be let in.

**Mova Globes**\
Along the top of the map cabinets in the center are a number of rotating globes on display. These globes are powered by a small solar cell which generates an electromagnetic field, causing the globe to rotate. These globes are now quite old, so some of them do not work as well as others. More information can be found here.
