**Event Setup/Teardown**\
During your shift, your supervisor may ask for your help setting up for or tearing down after an event. This mainly involves taking out, rearranging, or putting away the centerâ€™s tables and/or chairs. Your supervisor will describe the specific setup required for the event. When putting away chairs in the 4x4 storage room after an event, create stacks of six chairs before moving them to the storage room.


**Elevator Duty**\
From time to time, you may be scheduled outside of regular open hours to help with events. During these events, you will most likely be on "elevator duty," in which your supervisor will set you up with a table by the elevator door. The door will be propped open and your job will be to direct guests to the reference desk where they will be able to check in, store their bags, etc.
