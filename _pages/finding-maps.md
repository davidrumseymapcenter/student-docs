## Thinking Spatially

The [Thinking Spatially Toolkit](https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/thinking-spatially-toolkit/) is a good resource for researchers to use during the beginning phases of their research project. It provides information on research tools, an overview of the David Rumsey Map Center and Branner Earth Sciences Library collections, links to further non-Stanford catographic resources, and FAQs on georeferencing, GIS, proper citation, and other research-related topics.

## Viewing Material In Person
Along with digital resources, researchers and members of the public are encouraged to leveraged the 25,000+ physical materials in Stanford's David Rumsey Map Collection.

For someone to view Rumsey Center materials in-person, they first need to locate the deisred material on [Stanford SearchWorks](https://searchworks.stanford.edu). Then they will need to click the blue "Request via Aeon" button on the page located by the call number. This will prompt them to sign in (or create an account) and schedule an appointment to view their material. Individual appointments like this have a limit of 5 materials per visit, and can be scheduled outside of our open hours.
