## Food and Drink Policy

Food and drinks, including closed containers of water **are not allowed** in the Rumsey Center. If you see a visitor with food or drinks in the center, kindly ask that they please put it with their bag in the center entrance. *This goes for any type of ink as well.* If visitors would like to write something down or take notes during a class or event, we have paper and pencils available for them to use.

As a student worker, if you would like to step out to eat a snack, you are welcome to do so on [your break](/handbook/breaks). You may bring in water, coffee, or tea provided it is in a sealed container and you keep it below/behind the reference desk during your shift.

## Other General Conduct Notes

**Headphones and Music**\
*Please do not wear headphones during your shift.* With headphones in (even AirPods!) it can be very easy to miss visitors walking in, after which you will have to go get them and ask them to return to the entrance before storing their bags, signing in, etc. If you would like to listen to music, you are welcome to play music over the center speakers using the 4x4 screen, though be sure to pause it when visitors come in. You can easily pause music playing on the 4x4 by pressing fn + F10 on the keyboard.

**Handling Materials**\
Be conscious of how yourself and others handle materials. Thoroughly wash and dry your hands before handling materials, and handle materials gently. For your and visitors convenience, there are laminated printouts with the basics of materials handling practices displayed on them. Ask your supervisor if you have any questions.

**Event Setup/Teardown**\
During your shift, your supervisor may ask for your help setting up for or tearing down after an event. This mainly involves taking out, rearranging, or putting away the center’s tables and/or chairs. Your supervisor will describe the specific setup required for the event. When putting away chairs in the 4x4 storage room after an event, create stacks of six chairs before moving them to the storage room.
