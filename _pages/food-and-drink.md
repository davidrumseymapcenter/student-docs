Food and drinks, including closed containers of water **are not allowed** in the Rumsey Center. If you see a visitor with food or drinks in the center, kindly ask that they please put it with their bag in the center entrance. *This goes for any type of ink as well.* If visitors would like to write something down or take notes during a class or event, we have paper and pencils available for them to use.

As a student worker, if you would like to step out to eat a snack, you are welcome to do so on [your break](/handbook/breaks). You may bring in water, coffee, or tea provided it is in a sealed container and you keep it below/behind the reference desk during your shift.
