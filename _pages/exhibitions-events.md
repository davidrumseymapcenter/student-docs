## Barry Lawrence Ruderman Conference on Cartography

The Rumsey Center hosts a three-day biannual conference called the Barry Lawrence Ruderman Conference on Cartography. These conferences occur every other October and are sponsored by founding friend of the Center [Barry Lawrence Ruderman](https://www.raremaps.com/site/about). Speakers from around the world discuss the latest in the history of cartography and related fields, and several advanced Stanford students also have a chance to share their exciting new research in how they use maps as part of their scholarship, teaching, and research. More information on the conference can be found at [https://ruderman.sites.stanford.edu](https://ruderman.sites.stanford.edu) and you can visit [https://www.raremaps.com](https://www.raremaps.com) to learn more about Barry Lawrence Ruderman and his business.
