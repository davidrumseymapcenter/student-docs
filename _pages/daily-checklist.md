# Opening the Center
- Ring the doorbell when you arrive, one of us will let you in.
- Prop the door open (kick the doorstop into place *on top* of the floor mat- this will prevent the door from sliding closed over time).
- Switch the lights from “case off” to “case on.”

**Set up the iPad**
Unlock the iPad. Open the registration form in Safari (if it’s not already open), and then triple-click the home button to start Guided Access.

**Set up the 3x3**
Hit fn+F11 to take the screensaver image out of fullscreen mode and close the browser window. Open Chromium (the blue Google Chrome icon on the taskbar) and navigate to www.davidrumsey.com (bookmarked as “The Collection).

**Set up the 4x4**
Hit escape to take the screensaver image out of fullscreen mode and close the browser window. Open Google Earth (the white paper file icon on the taskbar), zoom out until the entire globe is in the frame, and then set the globe to spin slowly.

# Closing the Center
- Switch the lights from “case on” to “case off.”

**Close down the 4x4**
Minimize or close out of Google Earth (if prompted to save temporary places you can click “Discard”), open Google Chrome and select the “DRMC Events” account when prompted. Navigate to the screensaver image (bookmarked as “4x4 Screensaver”) and click present to make the image full screen.

**Close down the 3x3**
Close out of any windows that may have been opened during the day. Double click the Google Chrome desktop icon labeled “SCREENSAVER” and hit fn+F11 to make the image full screen.

**Close down the iPad**
Triple click the home button and type in the passcode to bring up Guided Access settings. Tap “End” in the top left corner to end Guided Access, and then lock the iPad.

- Close the door on your way out.
