## Calling out Sick

If you get sick and will be unable to make it to your shift, contact your supervisor and let them know ASAP. You will not be punished or penalized for getting sick. As a student employee you will still be paid for your scheduled shift-- you accrue sick leave over time which each hour worked. When logging your hours for the shift you missed due to illness, instead of filling out your timecard as usual select “* Sick Contingent - SKC” from the Time Reporting Code dropdown and enter the total number of hours you missed in the input field to the right of the dropdown.
