This site contains information for student employees of the David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford Libraries.

We are the premiere historical cartographic collection on the West Coast and hold one of the world’s great collections available for public research and global digital access. The collection numbers in the hundreds of thousands of digital and physical objects, with new acquisitions added on a weekly basis.

As a student worker you will introduce visitors to the center, answer questions that may arise, help maintain the collection, and contribute to digital projects that make our collection more accessible.
